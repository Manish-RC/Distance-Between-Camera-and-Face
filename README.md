# Face-Camera Distance Measurement
This repository provides Python code to estimate the distance between a person's face and the camera using computer vision techniques. The distance estimation is based on the size of the face detected in the camera frame.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV library (`pip install opencv-python`)

MediaPipe library (`pip install mediapipe`)

CVZone library(`pip install cvzone`)

## Customization
You can customize the code to suit your specific needs. Here are a few potential modifications:

* Adjust the camera calibration parameters for accurate focal length estimation.
* Modify the focal length value as per your camera to increase the accuracy of the readings.

## Acknowledgments
This project is built upon the foundations of the OpenCV, MediaPipe and CVZone libraries. Special thanks to the developers and contributors of these amazing tools.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out.

Happy coding!
